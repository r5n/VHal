VHal -- an implementation of the Hal theorem prover by L.C. Paulson

Introduction
------------

Hal is a theorem prover for classical first-order logic presented in
the book _ML for the Working Programmer_ by L.C. Paulson.  It works by
constructing proofs backwards from a goal; through refinement.  Hal
provides tactics and tacticals to promote interactive use.  More details
can be found on the book's website[1].

This is a simple implementation of Hal in Coq, written as part of a
Final Project for the course CS 643 - Formal Verification of Software
at Stevens Institute of Technology.

Parts of the unification routine are borrowed from Riberio et. al[2].
This is a work in progress.
